    <h4>A classic, can't-go-wrong hollandaise recipe.</h4>
   
    <p>Obviously eggs benedict is the main game here. But don't sleep on hollandaise-drizzled salmon or other fish too.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>5 egg yolks, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Pinch of cayenne, if you'd like</li>
        <li>Lemon juice, to taste</li>
        <li>coarse salt, to taste</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Put yolks into a small container into which you can fit an immersion blender, or into the jar of a blender.</li>
        
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan set over medium heat, then allow it to cool for a few minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Process the yolks for a couple of seconds, then continue to run the blender as you add the melted butter in a slow and careful stream, until you have a thin, emulsified sauce. Add the cayenne, lemon juice and salt to taste, blend again to combine and keep at room temperature until ready to use.</li>
    
    </ol>
